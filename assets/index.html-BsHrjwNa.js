However, due to limitations in audit logic and other factors, <strong>some SQL statements may not receive correct feedback</strong>.</p><p>Known unsupported statement types include:</p><ul><li>Complex queries (multi-table, multiple functions, not always reproducible; not all complex statements are unsupported)</li><li>Foreign key-related statements</li><li>Rollback of cross-database DML statements is not supported</li><li>Stored procedures/triggers</li></ul><h3 id="affected-row-count" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#affected-row-count"><span>Affected Row Count</span></a></h3><p>Yearning uses Explain to analyze the affected rows of SQL statements. Due to various factors such as primary keys and indexes, the affected row count generated by Explain cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. It mostly reflects the number of full table scan rows the statement may cause, thus providing optimization insights for statements with large errors.</p><h3 id="rollback-statements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rollback-statements"><span>Rollback Statements</span></a></h3><p>Yearning generates rollback statements by parsing binlog. Due to MySQL replication protocol limitations, an account with SUPER, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, or ALL PRIVILEGES is required to obtain binlog streams. Ensure that the data source account has the necessary permissions and binlog is enabled to use the rollback statement generation feature.</p><h3 id="no-data-in-tables-after-initialization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-data-in-tables-after-initialization"><span>No Data in Tables After Initialization</span></a></h3><p><strong>Common Issues</strong></p><p>Why are there only AWS/Aliyun environment names?</p><p><strong>Yearning only includes AWS/Aliyun environment names by default. You can add additional environment names in the settings page.</strong></p><p>Why can&#39;t I log in even though my username and password are correct?</p><p><strong>Yearning requires the database character set to be utf8mb4. Please check your database character set.</strong></p><p>Why doesn&#39;t the data source dropdown show the added data source information?</p><p><strong>The data source was not assigned to the user.</strong></p><p>Why can&#39;t the user see the data source even though it was added?</p><p><strong>Ensure that the data source is set in the &quot;single-select&quot; mode. If set to &quot;yes,&quot; it will only appear in the query selection scope, otherwise, only in the DDL/DML selection scope.</strong></p><p>Why is there no backup database setting, and do I need to install Inception?</p><p><strong>Yearning 2.0 uses its own audit engine, so no third-party audit tools or backup databases are required.</strong></p><p>Why did data masking fail?</p><p><strong>Data masking and limit constraints are based on syntax tree parsing. The query feature does not guarantee 100% support for all MySQL statements. Use caution with complex queries and those using many functions.</strong></p><p>Why do some pages fail to load data, with no error logs in the backend?</p><p><strong>Yearning is written using ES6 syntax, which only supports modern browsers.
