## Creating Permission Groups

![Create Permission Group](/images/group01.png)

Permissions within a group are divided into three main categories: DDL permissions (table structure modification), DML permissions (table data changes), and Query permissions (queries).

::: tip
When a data source type is read-write, it will appear in all three main permission lists.

If it is read-only, it will only appear in the Query permissions list.

If it is write-only, it will only appear in the DDL/DML permissions list.
