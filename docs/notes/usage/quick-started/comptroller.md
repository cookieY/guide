The auditing feature provides users with the **Auditor** role with support for auditing platform work orders and query data.

### How to Use the Auditing Feature

1. Assign the Auditor role to the auditing user (on the user page).
2. Once the auditing user logs back in, they will see the Auditing section in the navigation bar.
